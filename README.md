## 🔹 Research Origin
OHMNI is the result of an independent undergraduate thesis completed at the University of the Philippines Los Baños in 2025. It explores XR and hand-tracking as a platform for electronics prototyping, combining real-time circuit simulation with hand-tracked interaction on Meta Quest 3.
